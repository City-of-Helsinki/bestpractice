# Supported Browsers

Document about the supported browsers in the City of Helsinki.

Principles
----------------

The minimum requirement for City of Helsinki projects is to support the major browsers on both desktop and mobile versions that are 6 months or newer. 

Currently the major browsers are Chrome, Firefox and Safari. This also means that Internet Explorer 11 support is not required. Latest Edge browsers use Chromium, so usually they work similarly to Chrome.

If the analytics of your service show that some other browsers are used regularly, it is recommended to test and support also those.

Where can I find the latest browsers?
-------------------------------------

City of Helsinki does not maintain a separate list of the latest browser versions. Good source for the browser versions and supported features is [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com), where they update the browsers frequently. Also it is possible to filter the browsers based on the release date.
