# Coding standards

## Backend code standards

### Python conventions

- Newer projects use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) for Python code formatting. We follow the basic config, without any modifications. It should be required for new projects and is warmly welcome for the old ones.
- We also use [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) for keeping all the imports nice and clean. To make it compatible with black add the following line either to your project's setup.cfg file's `[isort]` section or to isort.cfg: 
```
bash multi_line_output=3 
include_trailing_comma=True 
force_grid_wrap=0 
use_parentheses=True 
line_length=88
```
- Ensure that [PEP-8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) are upheld with the help of [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).

*   Write [Pythonic code](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconslides/transforming-code-into-beautiful-idiomatic-python-by-raymond-hettinger-1),
    not [Java (< 5) with pep8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)

    Not

    ```python
    colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
    for i in range(len(colors)):
        print(colors[i])
    ```

    but
 
    ```python
    for color in colors:
      print(color)
    ```
    (CC-BY-SA Raymond Hettinger)

*   Make [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) tests,
    and run tests against latest released Python 3. Run tests with deprecation warnings on.

*   Use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install up to date (or older!) Python versions not available in your distribution repos

*   Use `pyenv virtualenv` (or `python -m venv` if not using pyenv) for creating virtualenvs, not `virtualenv` or other alternatives when using virtual environments in scripts.

*   Do not use print unless you really specifically want to print to stdout
    (for example with a cli tool).
    Write status, error, debug etc. messages using the logging module.
    This allows a main program using the code from elsewhere to configure
    the logging target (to stderr, file, syslog, or logging server).
    Do not use the warnings module.

*   Prepare the project for distribution in the same way as the
    [pypa sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject):
    Write a setup.py, setup.cfg, README.md,
    LICENSE (in most cases the MIT license)
    and .travis.yml files,
    create a directory for tests (named `tests`),
    *but* make a top level directories for the actual package code
    named `src`, *not* [the same as the package](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure).
    In case the project is not a reusable part of a bigger application,
    but a standalone app requiring a more complex installation
    (like a Django project requiring a database setup etc.),
    you can skip the setup.py setup.cfg.

*   Use static typing for functions instead of comments.
    That way IDEs can give better info, and we can do some static checking (so the type info will not get stale, unlike comments).

    *   Not like this:
        ```python
        def func_with_docstring(foo, bar):
            """Return the baz of foo and bar
 
            Args:
                foo: int
                bar: float
            Returns:
                float
            """
            return bar/foo
        ```

        But like this:
        ```python
        def func_with_typing(foo: int, bar: float) -> float:
            """Return the baz of foo and bar"""
            return bar/foo
        ```

    *   Use mypy for checking
    *   Use your editor tooling (for example PyCharm can benefit from types)
    *   Check
        [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) (function annotations),
        [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) (defined format for annotations + comment annotations) and
        [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) (syntax for variable annotations)

*   Use a doctest to illustrate use and also run the doctests
    (again, so that they won't get stale).
*   Use the [secrets module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) for cryptographic needs, not the `random` module
*   Use whitelists for reading `POST` data to avoid [mass assignment problems](https://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/mass-assignment-security-part-10-855/)
*   Do not use truthiness to check for existence, since values like None, False, 0, and '' will fail the check.
    *   Use `is not None` or `not in iterable_instance` and so on, as appropriate
*   Do not use assert for normal runtime checks (for example to validate incoming data)
    as they will be disabled with debug off (in cpython). Use plain ifs and then raise assertions explicitly
    *   Testing uses the assert as syntax sugar, which is fine. You don't run tests in production.
*   Do not use tuples as placeholder for lists you think will not change.
    Tuples are semantically limited in length, lists inherently might be of different length even if
    in one particular case they aren't.
    *   Compare the concepts of coordinates (always `(x, y)`, `(x, y, z)` etc.) to a list of Django plugins.
        Coordinates never have different length, that would simply be a different data type,
        but different Django projects have different length of plugin lists even if *your* app's doesn't change.
* Django database settings should have timeout to handle Kubernets services being down
* check that imagemagick isn't used

## Frontend code standards

Use yarn and webpack, not bower or grunt. Additional webpack modules need to go through architecture review.

Do not include node\_modules in source. If you need to build something custom, build it properly 
so that any (sub)dependencies do not get locked.
If you need to patch upstream versions, make PRs upstream and document the related PR to 
the repo so that the hacked version can be changed back to the official one later.

For React, use Redux as the store, redux-actions and redux-promise, saga or thunk. Separate API HTTP calls to a separate module/file.

### React/JSX style guide

We follow [Airbnb's style guide for React/JSX](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/react/README.md) with few exceptions which are listed below. Use eslint with airbnb style guide.

The main difference between Helsinki and Airbnb style guides is in the file structure.

### Folder structure

It is recommended to [structure](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) projects so that files are grouped together by feature or route.

If file count in a folder starts to get out of hand, it might be better to create subfolders for that folder (check `product/` in the image below). Then again you should avoid having [too much nesting](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#avoid-too-much-nesting).

There is no "right" answer here so it is up to you to find the folder structure that works best for the project. As projects grow larger, it might be necessary to rearrange files into a different folder structure. So choosing the “right” one, in the beginning, isn’t very important.

```
footer/
  Footer.jsx
  Footer.test.jsx
  footer.css
user/
  UserProfile.jsx
  userProfile.css
  UserList.jsx
  userList.css
  utils.js 
product/
  page/
    ProductPage.jsx
    ProductPage.test.jsx
    productPage.css
  list/
    ProductList.jsx
    ProductList.test.jsx
    productList.css
  create/
    CreateProduct.jsx
    CreateProduct.test.jsx
    createProduct.css
  edit/
    EditProduct.jsx
    EditProduct.test.jsx
    editProduct.css
home/
  home.jsx
  home.css
```

#### Separating domain and common files

This section is based on DDD ([Domain driven design](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/get-your-feet-wet-domain-driven-design-3-guiding-principles))

The idea is that we should divide project files between `/domain` and `/common` -folders.

**Domain**: Domain files are the project specific files that are tied to the projects business logic.

**Common**: Common files are the files that aren't tied to the projects business logic. Basically, you could share these files between projects, and even maybe make them as npm packages. Though, this is not a requirement for a common file.

```
common/
  utils/
    APITools.js
  button/
    Button.tsx
    button.css
  form/
    textField/
      TextField.tsx
      textField.css
    radio/
      Radio.tsx
      radio.css

domain/
  product/
    list/
      ProductList.tsx
      productList.css
    page/
      ProductPage.tsx
      productPage.css
    productHelpers.ts
  user/
    UserPage.tsx
    userPage.css
  home/
    Home.tsx
    home.css
```


### Naming

Airbnb style guide has root component name as folder name and the folder has `index.jsx` file. This makes it possible to import the root component by just writing the folder name into import path. This is not something Helsinki style guide recommends.

Example below shows the main difference between Helsinki and Airbnb when importing *components*:

```javascript
// Airbnb way
import Footer from './Footer';
// Helsinki way
import Footer from './footer/Footer';
```

- **Extensions**: Use .jsx or .tsx extension for React components depending on if you use TypeScript or not. eslint: [react/jsx-filename-extension](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-filename-extension.md)
- **Filenames**
  - Use PascalCase for *component* and *component test* filenames. E.g., `ReservationCard.jsx`, `ReservationCard.test.jsx`.
  - Use camelCase for *style* filenames. E.g., `reservationCard.css`, `reservationCard.less`.
  - Use camelCase for *jsx* and *.tsx* files that are not component files. E.g., `index.jsx`, `helper.jsx`, `apiTools.jsx`
- **Folder name**: Use camelCase for folder names. E.g., `./reservationCard`, `./footer`.
- **Folder structure**: Group folders by features. More detailed documentation [here](frontend-folder-structure.md).
- **Reference Naming**: Use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances. eslint: [react/jsx-pascal-case](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-pascal-case.md)

```jsx
// bad
import reservationCard from './reservationCard/ReservationCard';

// good
import ReservationCard from './reservationCard/ReservationCard';

// bad
const ReservationItem = <Reservation />;

// good
const reservationItem = <Reservation />;
```

- **Component Naming**: Use the filename as the component name. For example, `ReservationCard.jsx` should have a reference name of *ReservationCard*. Folder name should in most cases be the camelCase version of the component name *reservationCard*. Even though in some cases the folder name might be something more generic than the component name itself.

```javascript
// bad
import Footer from './Footer/Footer';

// bad
import Footer from './Footer/index';

// bad
import Footer from './Footer';

// good
import Footer from './footer/Footer';
```

### General syntactic guides

- **Promises**: Try to use await/async when possible. [Use await/async instead of Promises](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-stack-traces).

```javascript
// bad
const fetchAndDisplay = ({ url, element }) => {
  showLoadingSpinner();
  fetch(url)
    .then((response) => response.text())
    .then((text) => {
      element.textContent = text;
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      element.textContent = error.message;
    })
    .finally(() => {
      hideLoadingSpinner();
    });
};

// good
const fetchAndDisplay = async ({ url, element }) => {
  showLoadingSpinner();
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const text = await response.text();
    element.textContent = text;
  } catch (error) {
    element.textContent = error.message;
  } finally {
    hideLoadingSpinner();
  }
};
```

Use `finally` to avoid code duplication and to semantically
separate cleanup from the other parts.

If you need to run the Promises in parallel, use `Promise.all()` (or `Promise.race()`).

### Form guidelines
Helsinki Design System offers two patterns that are related to form design and implementation. These patterns give general guidelines on how to build consistent, usable and accessible forms and how to utilise design system components for this. Form validation pattern also includes code examples in React using `yup` validation library and HDS form components. While dynamic validation is the recommended method, HDS also has a static method available when dynamic validation is not possible.
